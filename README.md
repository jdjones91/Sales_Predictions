# Sales Predictions: My first Data Science Project at Coding Dojo.
### Files 1-4 are examples of data cleaning and visualization. Files 5 and 6 are axamples of pre-processing data and building 2 Machine Learning Models to predict sales.

# Business Problem: 
Can we predict product sales for a Grocery Store Chain?
### We want to predict 'Item Sales' with data such as 'Item Visibility', 'MRP', 'Item Weight', 'Fat Content' etc.

## I used Data cleaning an visualizations to gether insights into the data. I leaned about correlations, sales distribution across store types, and present graphical explantions primarily within Sales Predictions 4. These methods were used to more deeply understand the data.
## I created preprocessors for machine learning models. This is necessary for the data to be interpreted by a computer. Two models were then used, so I could choose the better of the two, as it is always better to have multiple options.
